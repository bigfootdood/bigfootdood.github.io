### Leg Mounts
* Looked for inside corner hardware and couldn't find anything that worked for all 4 corners. This is what I came up with. I thought this would be possible to fabricate in house for a prototype. (I'm no engineer lol)
* Sheet steel & Squre tubing + reinforced 3d printed carbon inserts.

Idea for the front that folds down on a piano hinge:

### Caster Wheels:
* I modeled the wheels after generic Harbor Freight wheels because I found caster quick release plates on Alibaba if we wanted to do this real cheap. I plan on also modeling a dovetail solution similar to the compeditor carts.

(More Renerings soon)
