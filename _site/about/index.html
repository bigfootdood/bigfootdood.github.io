<h1 id="my-objective">My Objective</h1>
<p>Learn more about emerging technologies via hands on experience and research. I am looking for a position that not only teaches me more about my profession but allows me to tackle some of the obstacles involved with personal growth head on.
<h1 id="my-education">My Education</h1>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Brookdale Community College</strong>: I attended Brookdale for 2 years as an alternative means to a high school education. After spending two years at my local high school I learned about a program at Brookdale that would allow me to graduate early and study both computer science and design. I met my requirements to get my High School diploma in the first year and spent the second collecting College credits.
 <li>
   <p><strong>Stevens Institute of Technology</strong>: I transfered to the Stevens Institute of Technology to pursue a bachelors degree in Computer Science. I am currently a junior on course to graduate spring 2019.
</ul>
<h1 id="technical-skills">Technical Skills</h1>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p><strong>Design:</strong> Having taken graphic design at Brookdale and Human Computer Interaction at Stevens, I find that user experience design is becoming a primary focus of mine. I have experience with the Adobe Suite specifically with <strong>Photoshop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator</strong>.
 <li><strong>Development:</strong>
   <ul>
     <li>Data Structures and Concurrent Programming: <strong>Java</strong>
     <li>Algorithms and Operating Systems: <strong>C++</strong>
     <li>Systems-Programming: <strong>C</strong>
     <li>Discrete Math, Programming Languages: <strong>Racket</strong>
     <li>Database Management: <strong>mySQL, Javascript(mongo)</strong>
     <li>Web-Development: <strong>Html, CSS, Javascript:Nodeâ€¦</strong>
   </ul>
 <li><strong>Operating System preference:</strong>
   <ul>
     <li>For the last four or five years I have preferred to use <strong>Linux</strong> as my primary Os but grew up using a Mac and I also run windows on a few of my machines.
   </ul>
</ul>
<h1 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h1>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Samsung</strong> 837; Mosaic Sales Solutions (New York, NY) seasonal VR Floor Guide/Sales Associate: (9/17 to 12/17)
   <ul>
     <li>Working at Samsung was as fun as it was demanding. My responsibilities at Samsung changed day to day. One day I would give demonstrations of virtual reality and another I would have to give a guided photo-tour somewhere in Manhattan. I really enjoyed the daily change of pace. The most important growth I had while working there was with my teammates. It was the first time I had to work with a team that was greater than twenty people. Getting to know everyone was intimidating but was well worth the effort.
   </ul>
 <li><strong>Brielle Cyclery</strong> (Brielle, NJ)
Sales Associate/Mechanic: (6/13 to 9/16)
   <ul>
     <li>I started working at Brielle with little to no experience with bicycles whatsoever. The owner, Cathy, took a chance hiring me but I learned very quickly and became one of their primary mechanics. Initially my responsibility was solely to assemble new bicycles but that grew to repairs and even sales. By the end I helped run their satellite shop in Asbury Park. Brielle was a huge turning point for my understanding of what to value in a job, my coworkers became family and I now know that type of experience is something I want out of any career.
   </ul>
 <li><strong>Early Work</strong>:
   <ul>
     <li>My mother is an event director and fitness consultant so growing up I spent a lot of time volunteering at events like races or grand-openings.
     <li>At the ages of 13-15 I worked and eventually ran a local Italian Ice shop performing not only sales but custodial duties,
store inventory/shipping and even new hire training. (I got unlimited free ice cream and it was amazing)
   </ul>
</ul>
<h1 id="interests-and-hobbies">Interests and Hobbies</h1>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Outdoors</strong>: Growing up I went on a lot of hiking trips which lead to my ultimate love for the outdoors. There is nothing I
enjoy more than skiing with mountain biking taking a close second.
 <li><strong>Design</strong>: Before studying computer science I identified as an aspiring architect and industrial designer. I still love design
and try to incorporate it in all of my independent projects.
 <li><strong>Art/Craft</strong>: I have been exploring sculpture (background of this site) as a means of expression as well as pursuing more practical crafts like leathercraft.
 <li><strong>VR</strong>: I was in the Samsung Gear Vr Beta which opened my eyes to the world of virtual reality. I strongly believe in the potential of the technology and despite not being a huge gamer I spend a lot of time sculpting, 3d painting and relaxing in my
Oculus Rift
</ul>
<h2 id="this-site">This Site</h2>
<p>This is my work log, a place where I will be posting markdown notes from projects I will be working on. The idea is that I could document what I do a little more often whether it be working on something new in computer science or just something I find fun or interesting. I want this to be a place where I can organize some of my thoughts and projects.
<p>I made this site using a jekyll template site called dactl made by <strong>Melangue</strong>
