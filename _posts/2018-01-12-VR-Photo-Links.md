So I recently acquired a Samsung Gear 360 and I wanted an easy way to send 360 photos over the web so that they are easily visible on mobile devices. I have prior experience with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) VR, a javascript framework that lets you create VR environments with plain text web pages.

Here is an example image I took:

Using a basic html page and magic from the A-Frame framework I was able to make a little photo gallary!
