Over my winter holiday I spent a lot of time looking through some of my childhood creations from my bedroom. I found my drawing book as well as a few of my sculptures. I realized that back then I had a creative spirit that had no inspiration from trying to impress other people. I made whatever I wanted even if other people thought it was dumb. This inspired me to take it upon myself to try to work on more things for the sake of just having fun.

I started making sculptures using Oculus Medium, a sculpting tool that utilizes Oculus rift's "touch" controllers.

Here is what I ended up making:

I don't know what it is and I don't care :)

I also decided to try and create a space where it can be viewed online. I used the same javascript framework that was used to make the vr photo spheres in my other post. You can find a link to it [here](http://christopherlyons.me/vr_spaces/01.html) (it takes a second to load). Right now the problem I am having is that Oculus Medium doesn't do a great job of exporting 3d models and when looking at the space I made you can see that the texture for the sculpture has broken into tiny squares that make a quilt effect. I'm still working on how to fix that. I also recorded the sound that is playing in the background but it skips and only plays on desktop browsers for now :(
