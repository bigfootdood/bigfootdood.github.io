## I got a 3d printer!

I have been printing things like crazy over the last week, but it wasn't until today that I experimented with printing something of my design.

Instead of printing one of my Vr sculptures I decided to make something functional. I wanted to make a sun visor so I could use my Nintendo Switch on the train. There are other models online, but I wanted to mine to use paper or cardboard to minimize the printed material.

Here's how it came out:

I went through four prototypes but ultimately decided on a simple clip design. The final result ended up looking like an alligator so I gave it a tail and eyes! The model can be downloaded here: [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2869938)
