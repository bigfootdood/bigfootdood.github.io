        <p>As someone who refuses the title of photographer but won&rsquo;t leave home without a camera, I fall in the niche (although growing?) category of point-and-shoot enthusiasts. I practically hate using a smartphone to take photos. There is something about holding a sometimes $1k+ piece of glass by the corners that takes you out of the environment you are trying to capture. There is an easy solution to this problem: Buy a film camera.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have a chronic issue that prevents me from exploring that world: <em>consumable hoarding</em>/<em>final boss syndrome</em>. In certain video games where you explore and collect items, sometimes you stumble upon things that can only be used once, so use them only when you must! I&rsquo;m the person who reaches the final battle with an inventory full of these single use potions and defeat the boss without ever using them because I felt <em>there will ALWAYS be a better time to.</em> This is also my experience with film photography (and instant cameras). I would carry a disposable camera for months before I reach the end of the roll, not to mention I have never gotten any of them developed. I know this might be a matter of discipline but I honestly find that I enjoy something right in between. Enter the Camp Snap Camera.</p>
<p>If you use Instagram and you are remotely interested in cameras, there is a good chance you have been served a million ads for this thing. The first time I was served an ad, I opened their page, and since then ads have relentlessly consumed my feed to the point where my friends were getting these ads, which they were sending back to me. I was clearly the target demographic.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-is-it">So what is it?</h3>
<p>According to their website, the camera was designed for one incredibly niche reason: for use at summer camp. Apparently, most summer camps in the US don&rsquo;t allow electronics of any kind  with the exception of disposable film cameras, or more specifically, <em>cameras without screens.</em> The couple who founded the company simply wanted their child to take more photos, and not have to worry about proper exposure so they invented a camera that captured the essense of a disposable camera experience, but with a digital camera inside. The camera&rsquo;s popularity outgrew its intended campers to instead be another product promising a nostalgic, distraction way to take photos.</p>
<p>You would think that sales pitch would be enough to get me to spend the $65 for the camera, considering it checks a lot of my boxes. The only thing that prevented me from pulling the trigger was those ads that I was overwhelmingly served. I had one thought: How much of my $65 would be spent on the cost of manufacturing a camera vs marketing one? Upon inspecting the website photos closer, the front &rsquo;lens&rsquo; of the camera is merely a facade, hiding what looks like a cheap smartphone sensor behind a large piece of plastic. I know I shouldn&rsquo;t be expecting anything spectacular but I was suspicious that I would receive something closer to the $20 children&rsquo;s cameras that you can find on amazon (that have screens). The camera has had a nearly universal praise from photographers who have reviewed it, but I suspect the Camp Snap team has been handing them out like crazy. In the eyes of a pro photographer, $65 is nothing for even a novelty.</p>
<p>Luckily I didn&rsquo;t have to make the decision to find out for myself, Santa did it for me. All those advertisements to friends and family paid off because I received an all black Camp Snap 103b for Christmas, and so did my siblings.</p>
<h3 id="my-first-impressions">My first impressions.</h3>
<p>I wanted to take every photo on Christmas Day with the camp snap so I quickly opened it. To no surprise of my own, the camera felt like the toy you would get from a happy meal. It was so light and cheap feeling that I knew my gut feeling was 100% correct. That being said,  it was Christmas and hopefully the photo quality made up for it.</p>
<p>The camera itself is simple enough. There is only one button to operate the whole camera. You hold it down until it makes a clicking sound, then it acts as a shutter button until you leave the camera alone for around 10 minutes before it turns itself back off again. You can also take a photo and hold the shutter down for it to turn off. There is also a small slider to disable or enable the flash, you can also just leave it on auto. There is also a small lcd that only displays the number of photos taken.</p>
<p>The design of the camera takes more inspiration from old rangefinders than it does disposable cameras. This is probably what makes the camera feel so cheap, if it looked more like a disposable, the weight and feel would be more familiar.</p>
<p>Using the camera is fun but a little frustrating. The shutter has a noticeable delay from when you press it, also the camera turns on in your pocket/bag all the time because of that single button. I was also surprised that even without a screen, the battery life is mediocre. Yes it will last days, maybe weeks if you don&rsquo;t use it. But if you are on say, a vacation and constantly turning it on, it could die on you mid day without an indicator to let you know when.</p>
<h3 id="image-quality">Image Quality</h3>
<p>To fully buy into the gimmick, I took photos all day and night without plugging the camera into my computer. This was a mistake. The quality of the images that come out of this camera are so bad that I wish I knew sooner so I could have taken the photos with my regular camera or even my phone. I&rsquo;m not going to go too into detail but the amount of digital noise and color artifacts you see is exactly what you would expect from a very cheap smartphone sensor. Everything is also so over-sharpened that its very hard to recover the images after the fact.</p>
<h3 id="my-honest-conclusion">My Honest Conclusion</h3>
<p>After using the camera for a month and a half, would I regret making the purchase if it wasn&rsquo;t a gift?</p>
<p>No! Surprisingly I have found a way to make this thing work. Firstly, I downloaded the black and white &ldquo;filter&rdquo; from Camp-Snap&rsquo;s website. This has made a world of difference because a lot of what made the images look bad now look kinda cool.</p>
<p>The digital noise now look like grain. To fix the sharpness, I downloaded an adapter to thread a mist filter to the camera to soften it up.</p>
<p>I have taken the camera to multiple concerts, where it is a no-brainer to pass between your friends (or even drunk strangers).</p>
<p>I have taken it skiing, where I have learned to love it the most because I hate the awkward wide angle look of action cameras, plus it works super well with mittens!</p>
<p>Similar to drunks, I have given the camera to small children to go have fun with. They photos are amazing.</p>
<p>So far my favorite part of using the camera is when I plug it in. I can plug it directly into my phone and I usually do so right before I go to sleep. When laying in bed I get to relive the day by seeing my images for the first time. I know this feeling is probably all too familiar for film photographers but there is something nice about choosing when you get to have this moment.</p>
<h3 id="should-you-buy-one">Should You Buy One?</h3>
<p>Right now, the number of photos displayed on the back of my camera is 827. That is way more photos than I would have ever taken with my smartphone. That is roughly 30 disposable cameras, which would cost much more than this camp snap. For me, it would definitely be worth the price.</p>
<p>Do I recommend you go out and buy one? Probably not. Despite the camera being a little rough around the edges, I have found it to be a perfect companion for a lot of activities where you wouldn&rsquo;t want a nice camera but also don&rsquo;t want to take out your phone. However, I did mention that each of my siblings also received a Camp Snap for Christmas and I would wager that some of their photo counts are in the single digits. Its not for everyone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably perfect if your kid is going to summer camp and you are ok with crappy photo quality or if you are like me and you are desperate to toss the smartphone but still want a something that actually feels like a camera.</p>

The camera’s popularity quickly expanded beyond its intended campers, promising a nostalgic, distraction-free way to take photos for adults too.</p>
<p>You’d think that sales pitch alone would have been enough to get me to spend the $65, considering it checks a lot of my boxes. But the one thing holding me back was how aggressively I was being marketed to. I kept wondering: <em>How much of my $65 is going toward manufacturing versus marketing?</em></p>
<p>Upon closer inspection of the website’s product photos, I noticed that the front “lens” of the camera is merely a facade, hiding what looks like a cheap smartphone sensor behind a large piece of plastic. I wasn’t expecting anything spectacular, but I suspected this would be closer to the $20 children&rsquo;s cameras you can find on Amazon—which, ironically, have the added expense of screens. The camera has received almost universal praise from photographers who have reviewed it, but I suspect the Camp Snap team has been handing them out to YouTubebers like candy. In the eyes of a pro photographer, $65 is nothing—even for a novelty.</p>

There’s a small slider to enable or disable the flash, though you can also just leave it on auto. A tiny LCD screen displays only the number of photos taken.</p>

<p>Right now, the number of photos displayed on the back of my camera is 827. That’s way more than I would have ever taken with my smartphone. That’s roughly 30 rolls of disposable camera film, which would cost far more than the Camp Snap. For me, it has absolutely been worth it.</p>

While I’ve found it to be a perfect companion for activities where I don’t want to carry a nice camera but also don’t want to use my phone, it’s not for everyone.
