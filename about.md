# My Objective

I want to influence the development of immerging technologies via hands-on experience and research. I am looking for a position that not only teaches me more about a new field of interest but allows me to tackle some of the obstacles involved with personal growth head on.

# My Education

* **Brookdale Community College**: After spending two years at my local high school I learned about a program at Brookdale that would allow me to graduate early and study both computer science and design. I met my requirements to get my High School diploma in the first year and spent the second collecting College credits.

* **Stevens Institute of Technology**: I transfered to the Stevens Institute of Technology to pursue a bachelors degree in Computer Science. I am graduating this may.

# Technical Skills

* **Programming:** 
  * Java, Python, C++, Js, React, Redux, Express, MongoDB, Sass, ...

* **Creative:**
  * After Effects, Cinema 4d, Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, light Unity

<!-- * **Development:**
  * Data Structures and Concurrent Programming: **Java**
  * Algorithms and Operating Systems: **C++**
  * Systems-Programming: **C**
  * Discrete Math, Programming Languages: **Racket**
  * Database Management: **mySQL, Javascript(mongo)**
  * Web-Development: **Html, CSS, Javascript:Node...** -->

<!-- * **Operating System preference:**
  * For the last four or five years I have preferred to use **Linux** as my primary Os but grew up using a Mac and I also run windows on a few of my machines. -->

# Work Experience

*  **Ribbit.io** (Hoboken, NJ) Full-Stack Developer/UX Designer: (Fall 18 & Spring 19)
    * Worked to develop UI for Ribbit.io, a service for finding and rating businesses based on their environmental impact. This was my senior design project for my last year at Stevens.

*  **Brompton Bicycle Inc.**  (New York, NY) Independent AR Developer: (Fall 18 & Spring 19)
    * Currently helping to develop a web-based augmented reality platform for Brompton to demonstrate the capability for their folding bikes.

*  **Gate Reality** (New York, NY) Social Media & 3d Web development Intern: (Summer 18)
    * Helped to develop the brand for Gate Reality by making posts for their instagram using After Effects and moved to working on WebGL based projects using Three.js

*  **Samsung** 837 Mosaic Sales Solutions (New York, NY) seasonal VR Floor Guide/Sales Associate: (9/17 to 12/17)
    * Worked as a guide to demonstrate the functionality of Samsung's Virtual Reality headsets as well as helping with events.
    <!-- * Working at Samsung was as fun as it was demanding. My responsibilities at Samsung changed day to day. One day I would give demonstrations of virtual reality and another I would have to give a guided photo-tour somewhere in Manhattan. I really enjoyed the daily change of pace. The most important growth I had while working there was with my teammates. It was the first time I had to work with a team that was greater than twenty people. Getting to know everyone was intimidating but was well worth the effort. -->

* **Brielle Cyclery** (Brielle, NJ)
Sales Associate/Mechanic: (6/13 to 9/16)
  * Learned the ins and outs of bicycle repair while developing a strong passion for working as a part of a team.
  <!-- * I started working at Brielle with little to no experience with bicycles whatsoever. The owner, Cathy, took a chance hiring me but I learned very quickly and became one of their primary mechanics. Initially my responsibility was solely to assemble new bicycles but that grew to repairs and even sales. By the end I helped run their satellite shop in Asbury Park. Brielle was a huge turning point for my understanding of what to value in a job, my coworkers became family and I now know that type of experience is something I want out of any career. -->

* **Bonus**:
  * At the ages of 13-15 I worked and eventually ran a local Italian Ice shop.(I got unlimited free ice cream and it was amazing)

# Interests and Hobbies

* **Outdoors**: Growing up I went on a lot of hiking trips which lead to my ultimate love for the outdoors. There is nothing I
enjoy more than skiing with mountain biking taking a close second.
* **Design**: Before studying computer science I identified as an aspiring architect and industrial designer. I still love design
and try to incorporate it in all of my independent projects.
* **Art/Craft**: I have been exploring sculpture (background of this site) as a means of expression as well as pursuing more practical crafts like leathercraft.
* **VR**: I was in the Samsung Gear Vr Beta which opened my eyes to the world of virtual reality. I strongly believe in the potential of the technology and despite not being a huge gamer I spend a lot of time sculpting, 3d painting and relaxing in my
Oculus Rift

## This Site

This is my work log, a place where I will be posting markdown notes from projects I will be working on. The idea is that I could document what I do a little more often whether it be working on something new in computer science or just something I find fun or interesting. I want this to be a place where I can organize some of my thoughts and projects.

I made this site using a jekyll template site called dactl made by **Melangue**

Here is a link to the original Repo: [dactl](https://github.com/melangue/dactl)

As for this spinning background, it is a sculpture I made in Oculus Medium. It is actually a human head if seen from the right angle.
