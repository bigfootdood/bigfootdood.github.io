## My Work Log

This is my work log, a place where I will be posting markdown notes from projects I will be working on. The idea is that I could document what I do a little more often whether it be working on something new in computer science or just something I find fun or interesting. I want this to be a place where I can organize some of my thoughts and projects.

I made this site using a jekyll template site called dactl made by **Melangue**

Here is a link to the original Repo: [dactl](https://github.com/melangue/dactl)
